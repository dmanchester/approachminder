From a Trajectory:
    Get icao24 --> [X]do a JS version of "AircraftProfile"; but for now, just string-based "icao24"
    Get a time-ordered Array of time and position

Given a JulianDate (that's what we'll get from viewer.clock.currentTime), and some number of seconds before it, get the latest position of each aircraft within that time window --> as an array of AircraftProfile, TimeBasedPosition
	Must acct for the case of multiple trajectories in the window for a single aircraft



An IO method that takes the import of the JSON (which is parsed for us!), gives us a Trajectories object

TODO Add '"type": "module"' to package.json and move away from ".mjs" extension?
